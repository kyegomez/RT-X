# RT-X
Pytorch implementation of the models RT-1-X and RT-2-X from the paper: "Open X-Embodiment: Robotic Learning Datasets and RT-X Models".

Here we implement both model architectures, RTX-1 and RTX-2

[Paper Link](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/)

- The RTX-2 Implementation does not natively output for simplicity a 7 dimensional vector but rather text tokens, if you wanted to output 7 dimensional vector you could implement the same token learner as in RTX1


# Appreciation

# Install
`pip install rtx-torch `

# Usage

## RTX1
- RTX1 Usage takes in text and videos
- Does not use Efficient Net yet, we're integrating it now then the implementation will be complete
- Uses SOTA transformer architecture

```python

import torch
from rtx.rtx1 import RTX1

model = RTX1()

video = torch.randn(2, 3, 6, 224, 224)

instructions = ["bring me that apple sitting on the table", "please pass the butter"]

# compute the train logits
train_logits = model.train(video, instructions)

# set the model to evaluation mode
model.model.eval()

# compute the eval logits with a conditional scale of 3
eval_logits = model.run(video, instructions, cond_scale=3.0)
print(eval_logits.shape)
```


## RTX-2
- RTX-2 takes in images and text and interleaves them to form multi-modal sentences and outputs text tokens not a 7 dimensional vector of x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw,and gripper
```python

import torch
from rtx import RTX2

# usage
img = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)
text = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))

model = RTX2()
output = model(img, text)
print(output)

```

## EfficientNetFilm
- Extracts the feature from the given image
```python
from rtx import EfficientNetFilm

model = EfficientNetFilm("efficientnet-b0", 10)

out = model("img.jpeg")


```
# Model Differences from the Paper Implementation
## RT-1
The main difference here is the substitution of a Film-EfficientNet backbone (pre-trained EfficientNet-B3 with Film layers inserted) with a MaxViT model.



# Tests
I created a single tests file that uses pytest to run tests on all the modules, RTX1, RTX2, EfficientNetFil, first git clone and get into the repository, install the requirements.txt with pip then run this:

`pytest tests.py`

# Todo
- Integrate EfficientNetFilm with RTX-1
- Create training script for RTX-1 by unrolling observations and do basic cross entropy in first rt-1
- Use RTX-2 dataset on huggingface
- [Check out the project board for more tasks](https://github.com/users/kyegomez/projects/10/views/1)
