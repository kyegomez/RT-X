    "summary": "This code imports necessary libraries and defines a function called `run()`. It uses RTX1 model with pretrained FilmViT configuration. It takes video input, instructions as input, computes train logits, sets the model to evaluation mode, computes eval logits with a conditional scale of 3, and prints the shape of eval_logits.",
